Introduction 

For families who wanted to migrate in Australia, they need a lot of things to know and explore on like schooling, working, eating
and one of the key problems that they face is where will they live? 



Statement of the problem

In this project, I wanted to focus on what city in Melbourn or Sydney Australia can offer the lowest home mortgage yet nearest to 
establishments or schools. This will be beneficial to families as they can already compare different places all at the same time.



The Data

The data will be coming from Foursquare. And country target is Australia particularly in Melbourne and/or Sydney. I wanted to give 
the user the location, distance, give tips and definition to the place and over all rating based on reviews of people on that specific 
area.
