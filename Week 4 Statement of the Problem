A Data Science Approach on Choosing the Best School in Melbourne, Australia

Introduction 

People nowadays are pretty much concerned on the early childhood development of their little ones. As they reach 4 to 5 years of age, parents
starts to scout to different schools in their area considering many difference factors. This project will give jist and guidance to parents
as they explore and make decisions on where they can enroll their kids to school in order to give the best foundation to their kids.

Statement of the problem

The project focuses in Melbourne, Australia. The battle of which is the best is being tossed from one school to another. Thus, schools are
tempting yet confusing for parents if they will enroll their kids in that school or not. That dilemma is what I wanted to address



The Data

The data will be coming from Foursquare and wikipedia. And country target is Australia particularly in Melbourne Sydney. I wanted to give 
the user the location, distance, give tips and definition to the place and over all rating based on reviews of people on that specific 
area.
