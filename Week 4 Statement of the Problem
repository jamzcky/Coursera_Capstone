Introduction 

Many people nowadays are busy looking for places where they can spend their long awated vacation. 
They are bombarded with a lot of possibilities and places to go to and sometimes other places are 
just hyped and disappointment occur in the long run. For this project, I wanted to focus on that 
area where people will be given a hint on where to spend their vacations based on their location, 
the ratings or review and other relevant information that they can use to consider before making 
a decision thus giving them a gist of experience onto the place before goin there.

Statement of the problem

In this project, I wanted to focus on city in Melbourn or Sydney Australia can offer the grandest yet lowest 
beaches and/or vacation escapades. This will be beneficial to families as they can already compare different 
places all at the same time.



The Data

The data will be coming from Foursquare. And country target is Australia particularly in Melbourne and/or Sydney. I wanted to give 
the user the location, distance, give tips and definition to the place and over all rating based on reviews of people on that specific 
area.
